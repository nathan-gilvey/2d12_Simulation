Chi-Squared test on 2d12 WITHOUT counting critical successes separately:

For 23 possible outputs, there are 22 degrees of freedom and a p value of 0.05, the critical value is 33.924.


The calculated Chi-Squared Value is 16.06012987012987

Since the calculated Chi Squared value is less than the critical value, this simulation accurately represents the output of rolling 2d12

Chi-Squared test on 2d12 counting critical successes separately:

For 22 possible outputs, there are 21 degrees of freedom and a p value of 0.05, the critical value is 32.671.


The calculated Chi-Squared Value is 16.176000000000002

Since the calculated Chi Squared value is less than the critical value, this simulation accurately represents the output of rolling 2d12
